Bugs are not errors; they are unexpected features.Software development is 90% Googling and 10% typing.Sometimes, the best debugging technique is to walk away.The only code that’s truly secure is the code that doesn’t exist.Keep your commits small and your dreams big.Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.Code like there is no tomorrow.Your code is only as good as your last pull request.Debugging is fun… until it’s not.Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.Segmentation fault (core dumped).The cloud is just someone else’s downtime.Pushing to production on a Friday should be illegal.A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.The best bugs hide in the smallest details.Commit often, push regularly, and hope for the best."It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!"Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.Deploy first, ask questions later.
